    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a qualified personal trainer with over <strong>7 years of hands-on gym experience</strong>, <strong>4 years of coaching</strong>, and <strong>2 years as a certified PT</strong>. Fitness isn’t just my career — it’s my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve won an <strong>Australian title in beach sprinting</strong> and participated in nearly every sport you can imagine — from <strong>soccer, AFL, basketball, swimming, tennis</strong>, and of course, <strong>sprinting</strong>. Competing and training across so many different sports has shaped my holistic and versatile approach to fitness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the years, I’ve built <strong>over 56 long-term strength and conditioning programs</strong> for individuals ranging from everyday people to athletes. Whether it’s improving sprint speed, increasing strength, dropping fat, or building confidence — I tailor every program to the person, not just the goal.
    </p>
    <p>
      What drives me is the power of fitness to change lives. It’s the thing that gave me energy when I was flat, focus when I felt lost, and drive when I needed something to work towards. I want to share that with others — that <strong>small daily changes through exercise can lead to massive life transformations</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether you're an athlete, beginner, or just looking to feel better day to day, I’m here to help guide your journey with evidence-based, supportive coaching.

    <h2>What My Clients Say</h2>
    <p class="testimonial">
      <strong>Ryan:</strong> "When I first met Brandon, I was over 100kg and had no idea how to lose weight without feeling miserable. His program wasn’t just about burning calories — it was about understanding my body. I lost over 12kg, built real strength, and more importantly, kept the weight off. Now I feel confident walking into any gym or even playing weekend sports again."
    </p>
    <p class="testimonial">
      <strong>Grace:</strong> "I used to be too anxious to step into a gym. Brandon created a plan that not only helped me get physically stronger but mentally more confident. He broke everything down and supported me every step of the way. I’ve never felt more comfortable training, and now the gym is my happy place instead of something I avoid."
    </p>
    <p class="testimonial">
      <strong>Daniel:</strong> "As an AFL player, I was already fit — but I lacked the explosiveness and strength I needed for contested play. Brandon built a program around my sport, focused on power, hypertrophy, and recovery. Within weeks, I could feel the difference in my tackles, kicks, and sprints. It’s been a game changer for my performance."
    </p>
    <p class="testimonial">
      <strong>Andrew:</strong> "Rugby is tough on the body. I came to Brandon wanting to get stronger and more resilient. He focused on power output, leg drive, and injury prevention. I feel faster off the mark, more stable in contact, and just more confident going into games. His style is no-nonsense, structured, and highly effective."
