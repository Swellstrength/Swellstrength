    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <div class="section">
      <h2 class="faq-question">What if I don’t have gym access?</h2>
      <p>Not everyone has access to a full commercial gym — and that’s okay. All our programs are designed with scalability in mind. Whether you’re training from home with dumbbells, resistance bands, or bodyweight only, you’ll receive tailored alternatives within each session. Our Athlete Builder and Fit Foundations programs offer bodyweight or minimal-equipment variants, with built-in progressions like tempo training, unilateral work, and isometrics to keep the challenge high without needing a barbell or machine rack.</p>
      <p>Each exercise comes with at least two alternatives based on equipment levels. For example, if a back squat is programmed, you’ll also see goblet squat and tempo split squat versions. If sled pushes are unavailable, you'll get options for band-resisted runs or incline treadmill protocols. This ensures that regardless of your setup — home garage, beach, hotel, or park — you can execute an elite-level plan anywhere.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2 class="faq-question">Are these good for sport-specific performance?</h2>
      <p>Yes. These programs have been used by athletes in AFL, rugby union, sprinting, open water swimming, basketball, surfing, and more. We don’t believe in generalised 'athlete programs' — every block is built to enhance the traits demanded by your sport. For example, our sprint athletes focus on acceleration drills, resisted sprint protocols, A-skips, bounding, and max-effort sprint timers. Our rugby players focus on rotational core strength, lower body drive, plyometrics, and upper body robustness for contact preparation.</p>
      <p>All programs come with season-aware templates. That means if you're in the off-season, we’ll focus on hypertrophy and strength development. If you're in-season, we reduce volume and keep intensity high to avoid fatigue. If you're pre-season, we transition to power, conditioning, and speed work with built-in deloads. Position-specific tweaks (e.g., midfielders vs defenders) are available with coaching consultation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2 class="faq-question">Do I get feedback on my lifts?</h2>
      <p>Yes. Technique matters. While many online programs leave you guessing on form, we provide you with the option to submit video clips of your lifts for analysis. Simply film your squat, deadlift, clean, or push-up progress, send it via email or through our coaching app, and receive a full breakdown from Coach Brandon.</p>
      <p>We look at bar path, tempo, breathing/bracing, posture, joint alignment, and movement efficiency. You’ll get written feedback plus optional screen-recorded cues or demo links. This feature is included in Premium and 1-on-1 programs but can be added to any plan. We want to make sure you train safely, effectively, and with confidence.</p>
